We have created a ML model using Xgboost that predicts the price of a house in Kathmandu valley given some features of the house. We have deployed that model in a easy to use web application with a pretty user interface. 

## You can find the code for machine learning part in `xgboost.ipynb` and web app in `RealEstateApp`. To view the clean data, you can go to `clean_data.csv`.
